*Model Driven Development for Spatial Simulation Scenarios* (MDD3S) is the name of the prototype framework that supports the DSL3S language. MDD3S generates Java source code from DSL3S models, finished simulation programmes that can be promptly executed.

MDD3S relies solely on open source tools:


* [Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) - an Eclipse add-on for UML graphical modelling supporting the DSL3S UML profile;

* [Acceleo](https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/) - another Eclipse add-on supporting model-to-code transformations;

* [MASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/%7Eeclab/projects/mason/) - an agent-base simulation toolkit.

* [GeoMASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/%7Eeclab/projects/mason/extensions/geomason/) - an extension to MASON supporting geo-spatial data.

* [GDAL/OGR](http://www.gdal.org) - code library containing a set a tools to read/write geo-spatial data.
